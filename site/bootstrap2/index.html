        <p>But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born and I will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it?</p>

        <h4>The first other blog post</h4>
        <p>One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams,
             he found himself transformed in his bed into a horrible vermin.
              He lay on his armour-like back,
               and if he lifted his head a little he could see his brown belly,
                slightly domed and divided by arches into stiff sections.
             The bedding was hardly able to cover it and seemed ready to slide off any moment.</p>

         <h1>HTML is amazing</h1>
         <p>The quick, brown fox jumps over a lazy dog. DJs flock by when MTV ax quiz prog. Junk MTV quiz graced by fox whelps. Bawds jog, flick quartz, vex nymphs. Waltz, bad nymph, for quick jigs vex! Fox nymphs grab quick-jived waltz. Brick quiz whangs jumpy veldt fox. Bright vixens jump; dozy fowl quack. Quick wafting zephyrs vex bold Jim. Quick zephyrs blow, vexing daft Jim. Sex-charged fop blew my junk TV quiz. How quickly daft jumping zebras vex. Two driven jocks help fax my big quiz. Quick, Baz, get my woven flax jodhpurs! "Now fax quiz Jack!" my brave ghost pled. Five quacking zephyrs jolt my wax bed. Flummoxed by job, kvetching W. zaps Iraq. Cozy sphinx waves quart jug of bad milk. A very bad quack might jinx zippy fowls. Few quips galvanized the mock jury box.</p>

        <h4>Yet another blog post</h4>
        <p>Far far away, behind the word mountains,
             far from the countries Vokalia and Consonantia, 
             there live the blind texts. 
             Separated they live in Bookmarksgrove right at the coast of the Semantics,
              a large language ocean.
             A small river named Duden flows by their place and supplies it with the necessary regelialia.</p>
